how much money did the EPA spend with technology?
 for 
stills 
Constructed 
~,f concrete, 
glass 
and other 
long-lived 
materials 
is twenty 
years or more. 
Other still 
designs 
have been 
developed 
using 
some materials 
with 
shorter 
service 
lives 
which must be 
periodically 
renewed. 
Assuming favourable 
interest 
rates, 
such as those granted 
to a public-utility 
type of venture, 
and service 
lives 
as noted, 
one obtains 
water 
costs of $3-$6 per 
1,000 gallons. 
Variations 
within 
and from this 
range are experienced 
because 
of rainfall 
collection, 
storage 
costs 
and unpredicted 
factors 
affecting 
still 
productivity. 
While this 
cost is high, 
T,hen measured by the usual 
standards 
of large-scale 
water-supplies, 
it 
is based on solar 
plants 
with 
outputs 
of 25,0CO-30,000 
gpd, 
or less. 
Experience 
thus far 
with 
other 
desalination 
processes 
in this 
small 
size range has snown product-water 
costs to be as high 
or higher, 
particularly 
when energy sources have to be especially 
provided. Dear Brian Stitt,
